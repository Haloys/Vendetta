                                                                                    then, you might say, we know a guy who destroys
                                                                                                functions instead of creating them ...


                                                                  But once again, thank you so much for finishing our game, this project
                                                                            was very close to our hearts, and one of our team members
                                                                                          even enrolled at epitech for this project.


                                                                    And last but not least, don't take away the project for the next year.
